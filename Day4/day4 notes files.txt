Local variables : their scope is limited to the function
	they are declared only.

Global Variable : their scope is allowed anywhere in
	the entire program..

Static variable : this will be used to retain the values from previous function calls and get the value. 
***For a static variable, you can initialize the value only once.....



& -> address of   ---> can be used for any variable

* -> value at     -----> can be used ONLY for pointer variables


Pointer : a pointer can store the address of a variable and access it without actually amking use of the OG variable.

Double pointer : this can access/store the address of the pointer which is already storing the address of another variable.


Arrays : 
They are used for storing multiple values of same type under one common name with continuous memory allocation.
	** To access the values inside the array, you need to do that by mentioning the index values.
	** Index values in an Array will start from 0 to size-1.
	** If the size of the array is : 5, it's index values will range from 0,1,2,3,4 (as we start from 0, it will end at 4 as last value)

** The array accessing and insertions of elements can be done using loops, because we need to repeat the same set of steps multiple times.


Null pointer : It is a pointer used to make the pointer stay stable when running the program or until the pointer is being allocated any value.
The default value we are going to give is, NULL, (all caps),

Ex: int *ptr=NULL;






int *ptr;   -> wild pointer

int *ptr=NULL; -> null pointer


int x;

int* y;
y=&x





int foo(int n) {		//4,3,2,1
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * foo(n - 1);
}

4 * f(3) ;
4 * (3 * f(2)) ;
4 * (3 * (2 * f(1)));
4 * (3 * (2 * 1));
